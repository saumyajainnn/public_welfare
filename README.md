Problem Statement:
Medical misdiagnosis is a global healthcare challenge with severe patient consequences. In India, the National Library of Medicine reports approximately 52 lakhs cases of medical negligence annually, with a 110% increase in recent years. Reports suggest that most of the time the skill or knowledge is not in question, instead it is lack of communication. One such case is illustrated by a team member's personal experience,where she faced a life-threatening situation due to an overdose of cold and cough medicine, resulting in an emergency ICU admission. This alarming incident demands the urgent need for an accurate and reliable medical diagnosis system to prevent such
misdiagnosis and ensure patientâ€™s safety. So we have decided to work on an effective and accurate symptom-based disease diagnosis system utilizing tree data structure. The system will prompt users to input their symptoms using an initial question set after which they will be asked follow up questions. Upon completion, it will provide the user with the most likely diagnosis or a list of potential conditions, along with relevant information about each. The goal is to create an intuitive and accurate platform for self-assessment of medical symptoms,aiding users in seeking appropriate medical advice and treatment.

Data Structures used: Trees
